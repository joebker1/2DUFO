# 2DUFO
# 2D UFO is a Top Down puzzle game where the player controls a UFO and collect the gold to take back to their planet. There are only 3 levels, as this was a class project.
# Collect all the gold nuggets for the level, and avoid the alien slime.
# Use the arrow keys to control the UFO.
# Press Ezcape to pause the game and then quit.
# As this was a school project, please do not copy the game, but please feel free to use any code you find useful.

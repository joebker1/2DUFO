# 2DUFO
## 2D UFO is a Top Down puzzle game where the player controls a UFO and collect the gold to take back to their planet. There are only 3 levels, as this was a class project.
### Collect all the gold nuggets for the level, and avoid the alien slime.
### Use the arrow keys to control the UFO.
### Press Ezcape to pause the game and then quit.
### The assignment was to create a game that had different types of transform features included: Player Movement, NPC Movement, and Spinning. I had the gold spin and had the Alien Slime move across the level.
#### As this was a school project, please do not copy the game, but please feel free to use any code you find useful.
